## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- Firebase v9.0+
- Modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- Visual Studio Code (recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com//PEDIASCAPE_Student_Platform.git
   cd PEDIASCAPE_Student_Platform
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Configure Firebase and Gemini API

#### 1. Create and Configure Your Firebase Project

- Go to the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a **new Firebase project** with a unique name.
- Add a new web app if you havenâ€™t already.
- Locate your projectâ€™s configuration keys (apiKey, authDomain, projectId, etc.).

**Important:**  
Use your own Firebase configuration by replacing placeholders in the project with your Firebase details. Update all relevant scripts/files where Firebase is initialized (commonly in a file like `firebaseConfig.js`).

Example:
```
// firebaseConfig.js
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  // other config values...
};
export default firebaseConfig;
```

#### 2. Set Up Gemini AI API Integration

- Register for Google Gemini AI API access.
- Obtain your **Gemini API Key**.
- At the root of your project folder, create a `.env` file if it does not exist.
- Add your Gemini API key in `.env`:
  ```
  GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
  ```

Make sure your server script (`server.js`) is configured to load environment variables using a package like `dotenv`:

```
require('dotenv').config();
const geminiApiKey = process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY;
```

#### 3. Update Scripts

- Review your project scripts (frontend and backend) to ensure you replace all Firebase config placeholders with your actual project details.
- Ensure your `.env` file is loaded properly and the Gemini API key is accessible where required.

### 4. Run the AI Chatbot Server

After completing all configurations, start the AI chatbot server by running:

```
node server.js
```

This command will launch the server and make the AI chatbot available on your configured routes/ports.
